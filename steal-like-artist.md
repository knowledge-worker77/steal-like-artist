## Have a creative mind

Creative people don't get their ideas from anywhere special. They just steal them from others.

No work of art is original. Everything is a copy of something. Sometimes it's more than one thing.

To be a great creative person you need to find a mentor and focus on how he works and what people does he look up to. When your mentor gives you any kind of advice, keep in mind that this is the advice he needed when he was in your place.

Be curious, Read more, Google everything that comes to your mind. Create things that you like, this way your true creativity will come out.

You can't be creative always, you need to take breaks, do other things before you can start creating again.

## Save your ideas for later

Don't go on a hoarding spree and collect every piece of information that you can find. Only select those that resonate with you. Always have a method of capturing information with you at all times

Steal from a lot of people all at once. Then combine all of that into your own unique version.

## Challenge yourself

Change your surroundings, keep meeting new people, Do different types of work. By keeping yourself outside of your comfort zone you'll be able to spark the unknown creativity that is dormant inside you.

Imposter syndrome will hit you when you're doing something that you aren't familiar with. But don't let it bring you down. If you don't know something just keep faking it till you learn it.
